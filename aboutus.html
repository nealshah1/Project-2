      <h5>This is a little bit about what we do, Dec 7, 2017</h5>
      <p>ISUD is a society of scholars, mostly philosophers, from many different parts of the world,
        devoted to promoting international dialogue and discussion of fundemental questons of universal
        concern, which affect all of humanity, such as world peace, human rights, dialogical interrelations
        of diverse cultures, and preservation of world ecology. What role does philosophy thinking have
        to play in moving towards a more rational humane future.
